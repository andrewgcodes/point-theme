## 📠 Fun facts

- I use em dashes liberally
- My favorite foods are avocado and ravioli (ideally not together)
- I can do single-leg/pistol squats but am *very* far from being able to do single-arm push ups
- I use [Missive](https://missiveapp.com/) as my email client, Visual Studio Code as my primary text editor (but tumblr.com/customize will always have a special place in my heart), Google Calendar as my calendar, and scrap paper / vim + .txt files for todo lists
